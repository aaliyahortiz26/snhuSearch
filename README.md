# SNHU Search #
## Summary 
SNHU Search is a web service that allows you to more easily search for websites. Users can customize their search in order to produce results that better fit their needs. This project will be made using C#, ASP.NET Core MVC. We are also using Jira to plan out our sprints.
## Project Vision
The potential customers for this program could be used by not only just SNHU students but anyone else. Will solve the problem of searching many websites that are not relevant to keywords that are searched.  
## MVP
The minimal viable product will give assistance in finding more relevant information faster and gives a more detailed search. The user will enter the website and keywords. The program would gather the keywords from specified websites, download page content and extract text from page, add text to search into Elasticsearch, run search for the keywords in Elasticsearch, and display the list of websites with hits.
## Project Scope
### Basic set of Tasks:
-	Section out who is doing what on the project in respect to skill
-	Learn elastic search method and logic
-	Be able to pull information from a web page
### Basic set of goals to be accomplished:
-	Be able to use elastic search on some given information
-	Be able to pull information from a web page 
-	Be able to create a successful C# application
-	Retrieve accurate data from web pages
## Constraints
### Time
With respect to time, we are constrained to two sections of time, our first semester which is composed of 3 sprints, and the second semester which will likely also be composed of 3 sprints. There will be two “showcases’ for our product, both of which have unclear dates as of writing this.
### Budget
The budget constraint is not going to be fiscal as this is a school project; however, it is going to have some varied levels of cost. It should be mentioned that a type of cost in this project will be time itself, as we deliver and allocate time for non-product development related things such as QA / review – both of which are crucial to developing the project but not furthering more features – these blank sections of time in development will limit our other factors of project constraints (time & scope), so we are limited in our time in this case.
